# OAuth Configuration
# AUTH_SCHEME controls the OAuth callback redirect URI:
# - "http": Uses http://localhost:5173/ (temporary workaround for dev and prod)
# - "custom": Uses gtn://auth/callback (will be used for both dev and production once custom URL scheme is added to Auth0 config)
# Default is "http" until the custom URL scheme is properly configured in Auth0
AUTH_SCHEME=http
