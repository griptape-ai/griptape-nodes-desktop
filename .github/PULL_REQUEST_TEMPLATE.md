### Release Notes Checklist

- [ ] **If this is a user-facing change** (`fix:`, `feat:`, `perf:`), I have ensured the commit title and body are written clearly for end users. Before merging, I will review and edit the squash commit message to be suitable for release notes.

> **User-facing commit messages should:**
>
> - Use plain language (avoid technical jargon where possible)
> - Describe the benefit or fix from the user's perspective
> - Include relevant context in the body if needed
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Title: feat: Add dark mode support
> Body:  The application now supports dark mode. You can toggle between
>        light, dark, and system themes in Settings > Appearance.
> ```
